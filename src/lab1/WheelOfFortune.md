## Before you begin...

There are a few things that you should know about this lab assignment:

1. It is a _pair programming_ activity. Pair programming is a software
   development practice where two programmers sit side-by-side at the
   same computer and work together to develop a program. There are a few different ways to do pair programming, and you should discuss what methods would work best for you and your partner(s). Both programmers should be focused on the problem and contributing to the group work; if you feel like you're getting lost, please feel free to discuss with your partner or the professor! If you find yourself settling into a rut or losing concentration, finding some way to mix things up (looking at the problem from a different perspective, swapping places with your partner, or even talking over the problem with your partner or the professor) can be helpful. When working in a group, remember that one of the most important components is communication-you and your partner(s) are a part of the same team, and your ability to work together is based on how well you can communicate! 


2. You will be editing this file using [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
   You will write your answers in this file, and this edited file will be
   what you submit for your lab submission. You can switch back and forth
   between viewing and editing this file using the "preview" button in the
   top right of this window. You don't need to worry about the syntax of
   Markdown too much, but it's nice that it's just text and IntelliJ can
   display it nicely formatted. Don't worry about getting everything to
   look perfect.

3. Each person on the team should have their own copy of this file, but
   I recommend filling in __one__ team member's markdown file.
   When your team is done with the lab, make sure to coordinate about how to get each team member can get the files the group worked on!  I recommend doing this before leaving the lab session, as it is very easy to have an issue come up (mistyped email address, forgetfulness, etc.)

   Make sure to write down your name and who you worked with at the top of this file and at the top of your Java code!

## Goals

By the time that you are done with this activity, you and your partner
should be able to:

* remember how to use `for` loops to iterate over arrays,
* use arrays in different ways to solve problems,
* learn some things about Strings in Java,
* and work more effectively as a team.

## Playing the Game

Run `WheelOfFortune.java` to play the game. It is a two-player game:
the first player should enter an English phrase in all lowercase letters
that the second player will have to guess, letter by letter.
You and your partner should play a few times before getting together
to answer the questions. Limit yourself to ~5 minutes.

Note that to answer these questions, you may need to go back and play
the game again to answer some of the questions to come. But you should
do so __deliberately__, in order to find something out, not just because
you got bored with the conversation or thought you could answer a question
better on your own.

## Part A:

- When is the game won?

  __Answer__:

- Can you guess the same letter twice?  What happens when you do this?

  __Answer__:

- What happens if you enter a secret phrase in uppercase and lowercase letters,
and then guess letters in the opposite case?  (Like the puzzle has a capital "A"
but you guess a lowercase "a"?)

  __Answer__:

- Is it possible to lose the game (without deliberately crashing the program)?
Why or why not?

  __Answer__:

### If you and your partner feel comfortable with the game, go onto Part B.
### Otherwise, check-in with me to clear up any confusion.

## Part B:

In Part B, you and your partner will explore the inner workings of this game
and how it is implemented in Java.

- What is the data type of the secretArray variable first declared on line 17?

  __Answer__:

- What is the data type of the guessedLetters variable first declared on line 12?

  __Answer__:

These data types are different!  They are both used to store sequences of 
characters, and we could have written the program using only one type, but 
I wanted you to practice with both types.

Now look at the countLetter function.

- What data type does this function return?

  __Answer__:

- What does the variable `secretArray.length` correspond to?

- Explain what the line of code `if (secretArray[i] == letter)` does:

  __Answer__:

- Once you understand that line, write a sentence or two explaining how
the entire function works.  Don't just repeat *what* the function does, tell
me *how* it does it in a way another CS142 student could understand.

  __Answer__:

- Would this function work if I moved the line of code `return count` inside
the for loop?  Why or why not?

  __Answer__:

- Would this function work if I moved the line of code `int count = 0` inside
  the for loop?  Why or why not?

  __Answer__:

### Stop and check-in with me.  If I'm busy, make sure I know you're waiting
### but then go onto the next section.

## Part C

- Go back to the main function.  Explain what the line of code
  `guessedLetters += letter;` (line 35) does.  Hint: This would work
  the same way in Python.

  __Answer__:

- Now look at the makePuzzleArray function.  What data type does this function
return?  

  __Answer__:

- Explain what the line `char[] puzzleArray = new char[secretArray.length];` does.
In particular, how big is the new array compared to the old array?

  __Answer__:

- Look in the official Java documentation online for the String class, then find
the `indexOf` function inside this class.  What does this function do?

  __Answer__:

- When does indexOf return -1?

  __Answer__:

- Using what you now know about indexOf, explain what the line of code 
`if (guessedLetters.indexOf(secretArray[i]) != -1)` checks for.

  __Answer__:

- Comment out lines 56 and 57 (place double-slashes before each line) and re-run
the game.  What changes about the way the puzzles are displayed?

  __Answer__:

- Uncomment lines 56 and 57.  Explain why these two lines are needed in the program.

  __Answer__:

- Comment out lines 59 and 60 (place double-slashes before each line) and re-run
  the game.  What changes about the way the puzzles are displayed?

  __Answer__:

- Uncomment lines 59 and 60.  Explain why these two lines are needed in the program.

  __Answer__:

- Back in main(), why is line 39 needed in the program?  (This one:)
`puzzleArray = makePuzzleArray(secretArray, guessedLetters)`?
If you're not sure, comment out this line and play the game!

  __Answer__:

### Stop and check-in with me.  If I'm busy, make sure I know you're waiting
### but then go onto the next section.

## Part D

In this last section, you will add some enhancements to the program!

- The first change is to prevent the user from guessing the same letter twice
  (or at least print an error message when they do so).  
  Modify the program to make this change (print an error message if they try to
  guess a letter they've already guessed.)
  Hint: Use indexOf on the `guessedLetters` variable in the main function.

- Next, in the real Wheel of Fortune game, each player may spin a large wheel
before they guess a letter than has various amounts of money on segments of 
the wheel.  When they guess a letter that appears in the puzzle, they earn the
amount of money the wheel is pointing to *per* letter in the puzzle that they
guess.  For instance, if the wheel lands on $200, and they guess the letter "T,"
and the puzzle has three "T"'s, then they earn $200 x 3 = $600 total.  Change
the game so before the contestant guesses a letter, the program generates
a random number between 1 and 1000 that will be the amount of money they spin.
If they successfully guess a letter, they earn that amount of money times
the number of times the letter appears.

- Lastly, in the real game, vowels work differently: they *cost* money!
Modify the game so that if the contestant guesses a vowel, they don't earn
money, but $100 per vowel they guess is deducted from their total amount of money.
